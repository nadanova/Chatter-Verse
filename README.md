# Chatter-Verse
Chatter-Verse is a multilingual LAN chat application with a user-friendly GUI. Built using Python's socket, threading, and tkinter, it allows seamless communication between neighbours over a local network. It also supports vote-kicking capabilities. Developed with my friend, Menna Alaa Eldin.
